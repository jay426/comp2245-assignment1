 <h2>Javeesha Burton</h2> 
 <p>  My name is Javeesha Burton, and Iâ€™m a 21-year-old student studying Computer Science at the University of the West Indies, Five Islands. I have a strong passion for technology and innovation, and I'm dedicated to mastering programming and software development. I thrive in collaborative environments and love engaging in projects that combine creativity with technical skills. Outside of my studies, I enjoy exploring the latest tech trends and connecting with fellow students, making the most of my university experience. I am interested in web development as I plan to open a business in the future and I would like to be able to make and maintain a website for it. p>
